                The following are best practices to reduce digital carbon footprints.
                <br>
                <br>
                * Reconsider the need for media: Assess the need for imagery or videos and include only when they add visitor value. Ban non-informative media, such as background media and autoplaying functionality.<br><br>
                * Optimize media: If you have chosen to include media, compress the file size if possible, select the appropriate format, and avoid embedded player plugins.<br><br>
                * Include labels and choice: Increase visitor awareness and control by informing them of the length, format, and weight of the media. Allow media deactivation, and provide alternative resolutions and formats.<br><br>
                * Dither images: Dithering can make images less resource-intensive by a factor of ten or more while retaining the same image size.

                <br>
                <br>
                * Use default typefaces: Use standard system-level (web-safe / pre-installed) fonts as much as possible.<br><br>
                * Optimize fonts: Ensure the number of fonts, and the variants within typefaces (such as weight and characters) are limited within a project.
