              Digital carbon footprints are estimated to be about 3.7 percent of global CO₂ emissions, which is equivalent to the emissions of the entire aviation industry. <br><br>
              Globally, the average web page produces approximately 0.8 grams CO2 equivalent per pageview. For a website with 10,000 monthly page views, that's 102 kg CO2e per year. That is amount the amount of carbon that 5 trees absorb in a year. <br><br>
              One of the biggest players influencing a website’s carbon footprint is web design, along with energy sources, website traffic, and data transfer. <br><br>
              This means that designers can make an impact to reduce digital carbon footprints. On this website, you will be able to learn and experience how we can make eco-conscious design choices.

              <p id = "box-4-content">Did you know that dark mode saves energy? <br><br>Darker colors require less energy to illuminate, with black being the lowest energy color and white being the most energy intensive. Google found that the Google Maps mobile app can use up to 63% less screen energy in night mode compared to standard mode on their phones with OLED screens. Moreover, on OLED screens, blue pixels use approximately 25% more energy than red and green pixels.

                The following are best practices to reduce digital carbon footprints.
                <br>
                <br>
                * Provide a dark mode: Try to provide users with an option of choosing to view in a dark mode. <br><br>
                * Use less energy intensive colors: Prioritize green, red shades over blue while designing. <br><br>
                * Consider accessibility: However, you should also try to strike a balance between accessibility and energy efficiency as white text on darker backgrounds may be hard to read.

                <br>
                <br>
                * Use default typefaces: Use standard system-level (web-safe / pre-installed) fonts as much as possible.<br><br>
                * Optimize fonts: Ensure the number of fonts, and the variants within typefaces (such as weight and characters) are limited within a project.

                The following are best practices to reduce digital carbon footprints.
                <br>
                <br>
                * Reconsider the need for media: Assess the need for imagery or videos and include only when they add visitor value. Ban non-informative media, such as background media and autoplaying functionality.<br><br>
                * Optimize media: If you have chosen to include media, compress the file size if possible, select the appropriate format, and avoid embedded player plugins.<br><br>
                * Include labels and choice: Increase visitor awareness and control by informing them of the length, format, and weight of the media. Allow media deactivation, and provide alternative resolutions and formats.<br><br>
                * Dither images: Dithering can make images less resource-intensive by a factor of ten or more while retaining the same image size.
